        <h1>SOLID</h1>
        <span class="bold">S</span>ingle Responsibilty Principle - One class should do one thing.<br/><br/>
         
        <span class="bold">O</span>pen-Closed principle - When extending functionality, old code shouldn't need to be modified only added to.<br/><br/>

        <span class="bold">L</span>iskov Substitution Principle - Making sure that new derived classes are extending the base classes, derived types replace a base class without affecting the functionality of the program.<br/><br/>

        <span class="bold">I</span>nterface Segregation Priciple - Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.<br/><br/>


        <span class="bold">D</span>ependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions <br/>


        <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
        Binding data with the code that manipulates it. It keeps the data and code safe from external interference. 
        <h1>Abstraction</h1>
        A process where you show only relevant data and hide uneccessary details to the client.
        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
         The mechanism by which an object acquires some/all properties of another object.
        <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
        The ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
        Processing objects differently based on their data type. 
        <h1>Decoupling</h1>
        Elements are "coupled" if a change in one forces a change in another. The act of decoupling is eridacting dependencies on other classes. 
        <h1>Cohesion</h1>
        Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) will do. Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions and is not focused on what it should do. High cohesion would then mean that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.
        <h1>Immutable</h1>
        An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be changed after it's created.
